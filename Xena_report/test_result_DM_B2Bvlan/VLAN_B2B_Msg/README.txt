B2B telegram makes use of the timing event frame. (payload 110 bytes)
B2B VLAN 6 priority 0 (Broadcast) payload 110 bytes. Repetition frequency 2.8HZ (SIS18). One acceleration cycle, there are 10 telegrams on the WR network. 28 packets per second. 24640 Bytes/s
B2B VLAN 5 priority 7 (unicast) payload 110 bytes. Repetition frequency 2.8HZ (SIS18). One acceleration cycle, there are 2 telegrams on the WR network. 6 packets per second. 5280 Bytes/s
DM VLAN 5 priority 7 (Broadcast) payload 110 bytes

The test measures the delay for the telegrams in B2B VLAN with the increasing traffic in DM VLAN from 100Mbps to 1Gbps .
